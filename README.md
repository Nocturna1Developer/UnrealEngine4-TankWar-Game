# My-TankWar-Game

This game was created in the Unreal 4 Engine in a highly detailed world in which several tanks battle until there is last one standing. The player will traverse through this world and encounter enemy AI that has pathfinding knowledge. I have used C++ and Blueprint techniques, Git as version control and backup system, Sound effects, and audio, and Vector mathematics and physics calculations.
