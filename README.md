# My-TankWar-Game

This is a solo project that was created in the Unreal 4 Engine in a highly detailed and atmospheric world in which several tanks battle until there is the last one standing. The player will traverse through this world and encounter enemy AI that has pathfinding knowledge. I have used C++ and Blueprint techniques, Git as version control and backup system, Sound effects, and audio, and Vector mathematics and physics calculations.
